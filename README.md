### How is it supposed to work?
This is the website that the finished videos (generated music and pictures merged together) would be displayed at. User would be able to browse through the different product videos with the arrows on the left and the right. Users would also be able to access the link to NASA's gallery webpage for James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, users would be able to upload (or select) space images they want to be turned into music from.
