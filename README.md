# Astral Harmony
### by Ridhanyaa, Nhan, and Ann (Students from UWC ISAK Japan)

We appreciate your patience and time for reading this. We hope you enjoy our project: Astral Harmony, where we merge music and visual art using technology and psychology. 

# Algorithm

## Videos

### What are these videos?
After we have the music generated from the image using the algorithm we have created, we add it to a video with the corresponding image. Please watch these videos at full volume (as they are not loud) to experience the beauty of space in auditory forms. 

## Prototype Website
Link to the website (prototype, does not work right now because we don't have enough time to implement the algorithm on the website):
https://github.com/annatequilaa/NASA-Space-app-ISAK-A-s

### How is it supposed to work?
This is the website where the finished videos (generated music and pictures merged together) would be displayed. Users would be able to browse through the different product videos with the arrows on the left and the right. Users would also be able to access the link to NASA's gallery webpage for the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, users would be able to upload (or select) space images they want to be turned into music from. 

You can find the code of the prototype website in the folder "webpage_final_product"
